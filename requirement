I want a lib for integration test that compile go code like in the example Integration Test 1
and run basic GUI(please pick lib that easy to use and maintain, and can run in any os) and list stages, that a user can click to run and debug. given that stage don't need to be run consequently.

the go lib provide a way to manipulate database, mock server, and interact with app server, and the expected result. in the easiest way
as possible.

the code of the lib should be easy to read and understand, also can be organized into multiple packages and files. all of the code is under V1
for able to update in the future without impact old test cases.
the GUI code also should be seperated from other code.
The developer of test case should not need to know how the lib work and how to write GUI code.

it is like robot framework, but for go, for easy for go-developer to write and maintain integration test.

Feature Concept

- Database SQL
    - Connect
    - Setup Table (isReplace bool,schema, table name, field (key, type), indexes)
    - Drop Table
    - Clean Table
    - Setup Table From Another (isReplace bool, table 1 connection 1, table 2 connection 2)

    - Insert Data
    - Replace Data
    - Update Data
    - Delete Data
    - Query Data

- Request

- Mock Server
    - run mock server
    - update mock server

- App Server
    - run app server

- Expection
    - response expection

- Stage

Example

func IntegrationTest1

    Stage("Setup")

    dbClientA := connect(127.0.0.1:22222, a, b, c, d...)

    setupTable(dbClientA, "table1", true, Fields[{"id", string}, {"name", string}], indexes[{"id", "name"}])
    setupTable(dbClientA, "table2", true, Fields[{"id", string}, {"name", string}], indexes[{"id", "name"}])

    ReplaceData(dbClientA, "table1", {"1", "a"})
    ReplaceData(dbClientA, "table2", {"2", "b"})

    mockA, RunMockServer(port, paths[
        "/a": func(req Request) Response { return Response{200, "a"} },
        "/b": func(req Request) Response { return Response{200, "b"} }
    ])

    RunAppServer(path and argument options)

    Stage("Case 1")

    resp := Request("http://localhost:8080/a")

    ExpectHeader(resp, ....)
    ExpectJsonBody(resp, ....)

    Stage("Case 2")

    UpdateMockServer(mockA, paths[
        "/a": func(req Request) Response { return Response{200, "c"} }
    ])
